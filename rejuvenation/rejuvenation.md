## Notes

Huge thanks to the creators of Pokemon Rejuvenation. Check out their page [here.](https://www.rebornevo.com/rejuvdev/) Another thanks goes out to [Dokoma](https://github.com/dokoma) for compiling mkxp. 

Pokemon Rejuvenation requires a lot of ram. The game has been patched for lower usage but keep this in mind, save often.
